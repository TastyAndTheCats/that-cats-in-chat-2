FIVE TONNES OF FLAX!
Fnord!
The universe is a giant game of cosmic ping pong, and we are merely the players.
Chaos is a necessary component for creating order.
The only constant is change.
The Law of Fives states that all things happen in fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of five.
All hail Eris, the goddess of discord and chaos!
The more order you seek, the more chaos you create.
Hail Eris, and pass the erasers!
The world is not black and white; it is a beautiful tapestry of infinite colors.
No rulers, no rules, only freedom.
Believe nothing, question everything.
Find your own truth, create your own reality.
The dance of chaos and order is what keeps the world spinning.
The only thing that is certain is uncertainty.
Chaos is not something to be feared, but to be embraced.
Embrace the randomness of life, for it is what makes it interesting.
The mind is a powerful tool; use it wisely and create your own reality.
The most beautiful things are often born out of chaos.
The Principia Discordia is not a book, but a mind-altering experience.
Reality is subjective; every person has their own version of it.
The sacred Chao symbolizes the balance of chaos and order in the universe.
The wisdom of the wise is foolishness to the foolish.
Hail Eris and revel in the absurdity of existence!
Seek truth not in absolutes, but in the contradictory and paradoxical.
Order can create stability, but it can also stifle growth.
Chaos is the lifeblood of creativity.
Question authority, for they are often the ones who seek to preserve the current order.
The Goddess Eris gives birth to both chaos and discord, and in doing so, creates balance.
Strive not for perfection, but for genuine expression.
Order without chaos is stagnation.
Discordianism is the religion of chaos and liberation, where absurdity reigns supreme.
In eternity there is no time, only an instant long enough for a joke.
Who knows? Life may just be a Positive Conspiracy bent on putting us in the right place at the right time every living, breathing moment of the day. It just takes a certain kind of perspective to see this. Realizing this can put our "analyzer" on hold, our interpretive mind on "ga-ga" and our hearts on breathless.
If organized religion is the opium of the masses, then disorganized religion is the marijuana of the lunatic fringe.
You have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor, and clad in them, your vision is restricted, your movements are clumsy and painful, your skin is bruised, and your spirit is broiled in the sun.
I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.
Everybody I know who is right always agrees with me.
There is neither truth nor falsehood, just what people arbitrarily choose to call truth or falsehood at any instant, according to their shifting beliefs, opinions and speculations.
There are no rules anywhere. The Goddess Prevails.
All statements are true in some sense, false in some sense, meaningless in some sense, true and false in some sense, true and meaningless in some sense, false and meaningless in some sense, and true and false and meaningless in some sense.
There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is Your Goddess. 
A Discordian is Required during his early Illumination to Go Off Alone & Partake Joyously of a Hot Dog on a Friday.
A Discordian is Prohibited of Believing what he reads.
In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted the ways of Serious Order.
The human race will begin solving its problems on the day that it ceases taking itself so seriously.
If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master sense, then each will expose the other for what it is: absurdity.
From that moment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of his surroundings.
Remember: KING KONG Died for your Sins
Keep in mind that the universe is in constant flux, nothing that occurs one moment has any relevance to anything else.
Everything you believe, feel, or think is based on the false assumption that truth exists.
Before I was a Discordian, I took life much too seriously. When you take life too seriously you start to wonder what the point of it all is. When you wonder what the point is in life, you fall into a trap of thinking there is one.
