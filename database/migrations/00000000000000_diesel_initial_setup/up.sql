-- This file was automatically created by Diesel to setup helper functions
-- and other internal bookkeeping. This file is safe to edit, any future
-- changes will be added to existing projects as new migrations.

-- SQLite does not support triggers in the same way as PostgreSQL, so we will not be creating the diesel_manage_updated_at function or the diesel_set_updated_at function.
